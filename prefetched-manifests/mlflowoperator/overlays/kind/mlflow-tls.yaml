# SECURITY NOTE: This file previously contained hardcoded TLS secrets which have been removed
# for security reasons. TLS certificates are now generated at deployment time.
#
# The mlflow-tls secret is now created using kustomize secretGenerator with
# self-signed certificates generated during build time.
#
# For production deployments, consider using:
# - cert-manager for automatic certificate management
# - External certificate providers
# - Sealed secrets for encrypted secret storage

---
# This file intentionally left as documentation.
# The actual secret generation is handled in kustomization.yaml via secretGenerator
