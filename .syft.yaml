# This excludes the dependencies that are only used for the
# component-codegen tool from being included in any source SBOM
# generated from the root of the main project. We use these SBOMs
# downstream to determine if any vulnerable versions of dependencies
# are being used, so excluding this subproject may reduce toil in
# fixing CVEs that don't actually affect the operator.

  - ./cmd/component-codegen/*
